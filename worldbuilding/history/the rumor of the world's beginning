# This is a rumor (possibly told through an NPC or narration)
The world started as formless void, and many people believe that is the world's truest form.
When sentience came into the world it needed form, to distinguish itself from the void
That sentience brought order, but also all the human weaknesses of power, lust, and anger into the void
And from that day forward the void was never the same...
